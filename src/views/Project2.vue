    text: `<p>In my environment, I observe many programmers who spend most of their working day in front of their laptop or PC and hardly move. They usually order their food online and have it delivered. This pattern repeats itself every day, five days a week. This inactivity can lead to health problems such as back pain and stomach problems, and their eyes suffer as well.</p>
    <p>That's why I came up with the idea of an app that addresses this problem. The app allows users to order food and pick it up in person. This way, they could briefly get fresh air, exercise, and save on delivery time.</p>
    <p>The app offers a variety of healthy meals from local restaurants. Users can easily place orders through the app, adjust the pickup time to fit their break, and enjoy high-quality food. Rewards could further motivate them to maintain healthy habits.</p>
    <p>This app would not only improve physical health, but also quality of life. By addressing the challenges of the modern workday, it promotes a more balanced lifestyle.</p>`,

    <li> <span style="font-weight:600;"> Eating habits: </span> This group often has unhealthy eating habits, ordering greasy meals and paying little attention to quality.</li>
